fully aware of the true meaning of his own discovery, of time as
nothing that is.
7. New Concept of Simultaneity
In a broader sense, the above zero modulo demonstrates the
non-locality of the universal present time, and that is the constant
present time of everyday human experience; it is immeasurable
now and must be represented by 0 (zero is a number without
quantity), and geometrically as non-local point (which has no
parts, no magnitude).
We should comprehend The Present Time as the fundamental
natural law which universally governs the change of the World
of Things (space and masse). This would mean that in physical
reality there are no time intervals as we imagine them, because in
the Universe there is not the flow of time – Constant Present is
the only time of Physical Reality (it is physical eternity).
Why then we have the impression of the time flow?
It is because the basic Continuum consists of unequal parts
which are subject to synchronicity law. The inequality of elec-
tromagnetic entities (of which consist space and masse) creates
non-synchronicity or motion which is pure temporal phenome-
non. The notions of Force and Energy should be substituted in
Physics by mathematical properties of physical bodies, as it was
already proposed by H.Hertz, who wandered why light does not
spare any energy for traveling, or by still unknown temporal
characteristics of bodies, as it was proposed by N.A. Kozyrev.
Proof: Dear reader, when you have started to read this ab-
stract, it was present time and still is. Since ever it was present
time, it is, and will be forever. Wake up!
